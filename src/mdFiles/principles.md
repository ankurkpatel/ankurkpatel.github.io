# Note to Myself

## Joy, Play, Beauty

- Choose interesting. Design a life that stays interesting.
- Celebrate small wins like they're big. Joy is a force multiplier.
- Default to happy. Keep it light; nothing is worth losing your spark.
- Make it beautiful. Feed your work with warm, nostalgic feelings.
- Keep it novel without burning out. Rotate toys, not purpose.
- Life is worth living. Act like it daily.

## Identity & Meaning

- Give things your touch. Meaning comes from making it yours.
- Remember who you are. Love the weird niches that move you.
- Seek nothing outside; everything you need is already here.
- Detach from identities to see who you are.

## Craft, Focus & Simplicity

- Constraints are blessings. Start broad, then simplify and unify.
- No clever bypasses. Finish the real task, then optimize.
- Take a simple idea seriously. Go deep, not wide.
- Break complexity with action. Think by building.
- Make it work, push it hard, then clean it up.
- Focus like a magnifying glass. Small target, sustained heat.

## Momentum & Action

- Protect momentum. Never break the chain if you can help it.
- Progress calms the soul. Move one step—now.
- Motivation follows action, not the other way around.
- Ship a landing page, get real feedback. Always.
- Action generates energy. Move first, feel later.
- To re-enter flow, stack tiny wins until you're rolling.
- Use emotional surges to break escape velocity.
- If you're lost, change the search space.

## Courage, Risk & Leadership

- Leadership = show up in storms and pull a rabbit from the hat.
- The river test: stop staring at the water—jump.
- After a setback, stand up and go again. Courage is reps.
- Work where others give up. That's your edge.
- Belief without reasons. Plant your flag and stand.

## Mind, Discipline & Grit

- Repetition creates depth. Routine is meditation in motion.
- Guard the self-talk. Your words decide your weather.
- Train the uncomfortable-muscle every day.
- If the mind is noisy, train the body hard; then think.
- Answers are within. Check inside before you chase outside.
- When you don't feel like it—do it. Shoot that voice on sight.
- Take your mind into deep waters until it surrenders.
- Resist cheap dopamine. Easy things hollow you out.
- Do hard things to stay yourself.
- Kill insecurity with learning. Be a loud beginner.
- Unconform. Your difference is a weapon.
- Endure and cope when you must. Keep moving.
- Outlast your mind's story. You can rewrite it.
- Sometimes try softer—relax into skill (Musashi).

## Perspective & Renewal

- Context matters. Advice only works in the moment you're in.
- Practice rebirth. Reset rituals > ruts.
- Borrow glasses. Use other perspectives to see clearly.
- Cure boredom with contribution. Start helping; energy follows.
- When foggy, go a little extreme to regain altitude.
- Touch grass. National parks are palette cleansers for the brain.
- Never return to the numbness of stagnation.

## Purpose, Time & Legacy

- Purpose keeps the body from sunsetting. Protect it.
- Stay in the game. Time in the arena beats talent on the couch.
- Remember time: you're not early anymore. Act like it matters.
- Build the man your future kid would admire.
- Read daily. Books keep the inner light on.
- Build tools that extend your brain. Augment, don't stall.
- When stuck, go animal—full commitment for a short burst.
- God felt right to me. Stay humble to the mystery.
